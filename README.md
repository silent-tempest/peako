# Peako
With Peako, you can work in JavaScript, like with [jQuery](https://jquery.com) **and** [Lodash](https://lodash.com).

Initially, Peako was aimed at speed (I doubt that now it works fast) and work in older browsers (IE8...) (Something really works).

You can use some modern featurs in old browsers: `_.Promise`, `_.fetch()`... (Thanks to everyone who maked these polyfills).

## Install
This is easy and only one (not only) way to do it:
```html
<!-- Import from GitHub CDN. -->
<script src="https://rawgit.com/silent-tempest/Peako/master/peako.js"></script>
<!-- Import local file. -->
<script src="peako.js"></script>
```
